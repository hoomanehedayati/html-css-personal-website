## Introduction

My name is Seyed Alireza Hedayati, though I am commonly known as Hooman. I am a 20-year-old student from Tehran, Iran, currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Marine Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), one of Iran's top-ranked engineering universities. Over the past four semesters, I have not only excelled academically but have also developed a diverse skill set spanning full-stack web development, data science, machine learning, and creative multimedia production.

My journey in technology began during high school when I participated in the Iranian National Computer Olympiad, progressing to Round 2 at the national level. This experience ignited my passion for computer science and algorithmic problem-solving. Simultaneously, I achieved a ranking in the top 1000 nationwide in the Iranian National University Entrance Exam (Konkur), demonstrating my academic excellence and dedication to learning.

## Academic Background

I graduated from Shahed High School in June 2023 with a diploma in Mathematics and Physics, achieving a GPA of 17.5 out of 20. My strong performance in the national entrance exam and participation in the Computer Olympiad reflect my commitment to academic excellence and my natural aptitude for technical subjects.

Currently, I am in my second year at Amirkabir University of Technology, having completed four semesters of Marine Engineering. While my current program has provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles, I have discovered that my true passion lies in computer science, software engineering, and data science. The intersection of technology, data analysis, and creative problem-solving is where I find my greatest motivation and potential for contribution.

My English proficiency, validated by an IELTS Academic score of 7.5 achieved in September 2025, enables me to engage effectively in an international academic environment and access cutting-edge research and resources in my field of interest.

## Technical Skills and Projects

My technical journey has been marked by continuous learning and practical application. I have developed expertise across multiple domains:

**Programming and Web Development:** I have achieved intermediate to advanced proficiency in Python, with extensive experience in machine learning and data science libraries. My web development skills include advanced HTML/CSS, intermediate-level React, and Node.js for backend development. I have also explored Swift for mobile development and maintain a strong interest in Web3 and blockchain technologies.

**Data Science and Machine Learning:** Through projects like my Housing Price Predictor, I have implemented machine learning models using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor, comparing their performance and understanding the nuances of model selection. My Customer Segmentation project demonstrates my ability to apply RFM analysis to real-world business problems, while my Sales Analytics Dashboard showcases skills in data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.

**Full-Stack Development:** My E-commerce Mini Store project represents a complete full-stack application with Flask backend, SQLite database, RESTful API design, and responsive frontend. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate multiple technologies and create production-ready applications.

**Creative and Technical Integration:** Beyond pure programming, I have combined technical skills with creative multimedia production. As a freelancer, I have designed and developed websites while also producing photography and video content. My experience using AI tools for content generation reflects my interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative workflows.

## Professional Experience

Since March 2023, I have worked as a Multimedia & Web Freelancer, designing and developing websites for clients while producing photography and video content using professional tools like Premiere Pro and Photoshop. This experience has taught me to balance technical requirements with creative vision and to manage client relationships effectively.

From April to August 2025, I served as an intern and part-time employee at Leejo, a Chinese lighting components company. In this role, I contributed to marketing content through photography and videography, provided administrative and digital project support, and collaborated in an international team environment. This experience was particularly valuable as it exposed me to cross-cultural collaboration and the practical application of my technical and creative skills in a business context.

## Research Interests and Academic Goals

My interests span several exciting areas at the intersection of technology and innovation:

**Web3 and Blockchain Technology:** I have a strong interest in decentralized systems, smart contracts, and the potential of blockchain technology to transform various industries. I am actively engaged in self-study in this area and see tremendous potential for research and development.

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:** My projects in machine learning have sparked a deep interest in AI applications, particularly in creative workflows and data-driven decision making. I am fascinated by how AI can enhance human creativity and productivity.

**Data Science and Analytics:** The ability to extract meaningful insights from data and create visualizations that drive decision-making is a skill I have developed through multiple projects. I am interested in exploring advanced analytics techniques and their applications.

**Full-Stack Development:** Building complete applications that solve real problems is where I find the most satisfaction. I am interested in exploring modern frameworks, architectural patterns, and best practices in software engineering.

My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of innovative software solutions that combine technical excellence with practical applications. I envision myself working on projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world problems, whether in web development, data science, or emerging fields like Web3.
